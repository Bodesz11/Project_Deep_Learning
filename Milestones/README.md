# The milestones for the project in Deep Learning
Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 are all Jupyter Notebooks with the current progress into the project.

# Milestone 1 
Contains the data loading, shows some of the data. This was one of the hardest tasks, beacuse the data in our case was REALLY BIG, therefore we had to make preperations to make everything work

# Milestone 2 
Contains an already working model with some decent accuracy. Later we made it work by optimizing its hyperparameters. We used mostly RESNET50 in our models.

# Attention!
We gave the Milestones in time, but when we were reorganizing the data structure (making directories for better visual) we had to upload the files again, so the upload dates may differ from the original ones.
