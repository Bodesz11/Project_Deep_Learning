# Model training Jupyter notebooks

Here are 2 of the major Jupyter notebooks we used for training the RESNET50 based models. These contain:
- data loading
- data preperation
- model creation
- model training
- making predictions

ATTENTION!
PLEASE DO NOT RERUN these jupyter notebooks, we had to download 105 GB of data to make them work, and we could not possibly find a solution to make it work in a cloud service
